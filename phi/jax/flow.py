"""
Standard import for *experimental* Jax mode.

Extends the import `from phi.flow import *` by Jax-related functions and modules.

The following Jax modules are included: `jax`, `jax.numpy` as `jnp`, `jax.scipy` as `jsp`.

Importing this module registers the Jax backend as the default backend.
New tensors created via `phi.math` functions will be backed by Jax tensors.

See `phi.flow`, `phi.torch.flow`.
